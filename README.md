## Overview

### Frontend

The web application presents a dashboard with visualizations of the various data
collected from the Spotify API for the current user.

The frontend is developed using React and handles presenting information to the user.

### CLI

Data can be accessed and visualized via the terminal as well by using the CLI.

### Backend

Multiple services will encompass the backend functionality of the application.

Currently, only an API service exists to communicate with Spotify and retrieve
the requested information.
